/**
 * Default system plans — created once at installation.
 *
 * Idempotent and safe to run on every deploy, but deliberately NON-DESTRUCTIVE:
 * a plan that already exists is left completely alone. Once a super-admin has
 * edited pricing or limits through the console, a redeploy resetting them to the
 * values checked into git would be a billing incident.
 *
 * `--force-update` re-applies the seed values, including feature rows. Use it
 * intentionally, never as part of an automated deploy.
 *
 * `--prune` deletes plans that are NOT in the seed — the ones hand-created in
 * the console. A plan with subscribers is never deleted; it is reported so the
 * operator can retire it instead. Together the two flags make this file the
 * authoritative definition of the catalogue.
 *
 * Run:  npx tsx src/scripts/seedPlans.ts [--force-update] [--prune]
