 * would mean a signed-URL scheme, which is not worth it for branding assets.
 *

 * tenant check. What it relies on: filenames carry ~30 bits of randomness
 * (`<prefix>-<epoch-ms>-<rand 1e9>.<ext>`) and are never listed, so the URL is
 * the capability. Directory listing is off by default in express.static.

 * private storage with signed URLs rather than bolting auth onto this mount.
